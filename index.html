          <p>
            <strong>&#60;a></strong> -element (or anchor element), with its href
            attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses,
            locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;abbr></strong> -element represents an abbreviation or
            acronym.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="dep"><del>&#60;acronym></del> Deprocated</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;address></strong> -element indicates that the enclosed
            HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an
            organization.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;area></strong> -element defines an area inside an image
            map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows
            geometric areas on an image to be associated with hypertext links.
            This element is only used within a &#60;map> element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;article></strong> -element represents a self-contained
            composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is
            intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in
            syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or
            newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted
            comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent
            item of content
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;aside></strong> -element represents a portion of a
            document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's
            main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or
            call-out boxes
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;audio></strong> -element is used to embed sound content
            in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented
            using the src attribute or the &#60;source> element: the browser
            will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination
            for streamed media, using a MediaStream
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;b></strong> -element is used to draw the reader's
            attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted
            special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element,
            and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you
            should not use &#60;b> for styling text or granting importance. If
            you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight
            property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special
            importance, you should use the &#60;strong> element
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;base></strong> -element specifies the base URL to use
            for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one
            &#60;base> element in a document. A document's used base URL can be
            accessed by scripts with Node.baseURI. If the document has no
            &#60;base> elements, then baseURI defaults to location.href.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;bdi></strong> -element tells the browser's
            bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation
            from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website
            dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of
            the text being inserted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;bdo></strong> -element overrides the current
            directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a
            different direction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;bgsound></strong> -element indicates that the enclosed
            text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by
            indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source
            of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text
            representation of the source can be given using the &#60;cite>
            element.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;blockquote></strong> -element indicates that the
            enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered
            visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for
            the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute,
            while a text representation of the source can be given using the
            &#60;cite> element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;body></strong> -element represents the content of an
            HTML document. There can be only one &#60;body> element in a
            document.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;br></strong> -element produces a line break in text
            (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address,
            where the division of lines is significant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;button></strong> -element is an interactive element
            activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command,
            or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an
            action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog. By default,
            HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the
            user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;canvas></strong> -Use the HTML &#60;canvas> element
            with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw
            graphics and animations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;caption></strong> -element specifies the caption (or
            title) of a table.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;cite></strong> -element is used to mark up the title of
            a cited creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form
            according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation
            metadata.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;code></strong> -element displays its contents styled in
            a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of
            computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the
            user agent's default monospace font.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;col></strong> -element defines a column within a table
            and is used for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is
            generally found within a &#60;colgroup> element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;colgroup></strong> -element defines a group of columns
            within a table.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="dep"><del>&#60;content></del> Deprocated</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;data></strong> -element links a given piece of content
            with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or
            date-related, the &#60;time> element must be used.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;datalist></strong> -element contains a set of
            &#60;option> elements that represent the permissible or recommended
            options available to choose from within other controls.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>&#60;dd></strong> -element provides the description,
            definition, or value for the preceding term (&#60;dt>) in a
            description list (&#60;dl>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;del></strong> -element represents a range of text that
            has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering
            "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The
            &#60;ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate
            text that has been added to the document.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;details></strong> -element creates a disclosure widget
            in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into
            an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the
            &#60;summary> element. A disclosure widget is typically presented
            onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to
            indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. The
            contents of the &#60;summary> element are used as the label for the
            disclosure widget.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;dfn></strong> -element is used to indicate the term
            being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence.
            The ancestor &#60;p> element, the &#60;dt>/&#60;dd> pairing, or the
            nearest &#60;section> ancestor of the &#60;dfn> element, is
            considered to be the definition of the term.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;dialog></strong> -element represents a dialog box or
            other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector,
            or subwindow.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="dep"><del>&#60;dir></del> Deprocated</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;div></strong> -element is the generic container for
            flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled
            in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or
            some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent
            element).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;dl></strong> -element represents a description list.
            The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the
            &#60;dt> element) and descriptions (provided by &#60;dd> elements).
            Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to
            display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;dt></strong> -element represents a description list.
            The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the

            <strong>&#60;em></strong> -element marks text that has stress
            emphasis. The &#60;em> element can be nested, with each level of
            nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;embed></strong> -element embeds external content at the
            specified point in the document. This content is provided by an
            external application or other source of interactive content such as
            a browser plug-in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;fieldset></strong> -element is used to group several
            controls as well as labels (&#60;label>) within a web form.

          <p>
            <strong>&#60;hgroup></strong> -element represents a heading and
            related content. It groups a single &#60;h1>–&#60;h6> element with
            one or more &#60;p>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;hr></strong> -element represents a thematic break

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;html></strong> -element represents the root (top-level
            element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root
            element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;i></strong> -element represents a range of text that is
            set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic
            text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others.
            Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which
            is the original source of the &#60;i> naming of this element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;iframe></strong> -element represents a nested browsing

            <strong>&#60;input></strong> -element is used to create interactive
            controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user;
            a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are
            available, depending on the device and user agent. The &#60;input>
            element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due
            to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

            <strong>&#60;ins></strong> -element represents a range of text that
            has been added to a document. You can use the &#60;del> element to
            similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the
            document.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;kbd></strong> -element represents a span of inline text
            denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any
            other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to
            rendering the contents of a &#60;kbd> element using its default
            monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;legend></strong> -element represents a caption for the

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;li></strong> -element is used to represent an item in a
            list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list
            (&#60;ol>), an unordered list (&#60;ul>), or a menu (&#60;menu>). In
            menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using
            bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an
            ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;link></strong> -element specifies relationships between
            the current document and an external resource. This element is most
            commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish
            site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen
            and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;main></strong> -element represents the dominant content
            of the &#60;body> of a document. The main content area consists of
            content that is directly related to or expands upon the central
            topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;map></strong> -element is used with &#60;area> elements
            to define an image map (a clickable link area).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;mark></strong> -element represents text which is marked
            or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked
            passage's relevance in the enclosing context.
          </p>

            <strong>&#60;menu></strong> -element is described in the HTML
            specification as a semantic alternative to &#60;ul>, but treated by
            browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no
            different than &#60;ul>. It represents an unordered list of items
            (which are represented by &#60;li> elements).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;meta></strong> -element represents metadata that cannot
            be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like &#60;base>,
            &#60;link>, &#60;script>, &#60;style> or &#60;title>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;meter></strong> -element represents either a scalar

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;nav></strong> -element represents a section of a page
            whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the
            current document or to other documents. Common examples of
            navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;noscript></strong> -element defines a section of HTML
            to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if
            scripting is currently turned off in the browser.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;object></strong> -element represents an external
            resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing
            context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;ol></strong> -element represents an ordered list of
            items — typically rendered as a numbered list.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;optgroup></strong> -element creates a grouping of
            options within a &#60;select> element.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;option></strong> -element is used to define an item
            contained in a &#60;select>, an &#60;optgroup>, or a &#60;datalist>
            element. As such, &#60;option> can represent menu items in popups
            and other lists of items in an HTML document.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;output></strong> -element is a container element into
            which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the
            outcome of a user action.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;p></strong> -element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs
            are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated
            from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation,
            but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related
            content, such as images or form fields.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;picture></strong> -element contains zero or more
            &#60;source> elements and one &#60;img> element to offer alternative
            versions of an image for different display/device scenarios. The
            browser will consider each child &#60;source> element and choose the
            best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser
            doesn\'t support the &#60;picture> element—the URL of the &#60;img>
            element's src attribute is selected. The selected image is then
            presented in the space occupied by the &#60;img> element.

            <strong>&#60;portal></strong> -element enables the embedding of
            another HTML page into the current one for the purposes of allowing
            smoother navigation into new pages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;pre></strong> -element represents preformatted text
            which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The
            text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced,
            font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;progress></strong> -element displays an indicator
            showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a
            progress bar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;q></strong> -element indicates that the enclosed text
            is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by
            surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended
            for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long
            quotations use the &#60;blockquote> element.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;rp></strong> -element is used to provide fall-back
            parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby
            annotations using the &#60;ruby> element. One &#60;rp> element
            should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap
            the &#60;rt> element that contains the annotation's text.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;rt></strong> -element specifies the ruby text component
            of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation,
            translation, or transliteration information for East Asian
            typography. The &#60;rt> element must always be contained within a
            &#60;ruby> element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="dep"><del>&#60;rtc></del> Deprocated</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;ruby></strong> -element represents small annotations
            that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used
            for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also
            be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less
            common. The term ruby originated as a unit of measurement used by
            typesetters, representing the smallest size that text can be printed
            on newsprint while remaining legible.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;s></strong> -element renders text with a strikethrough,
            or a line through it. Use the &#60;s> element to represent things
            that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, &#60;s>
            is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the
            &#60;del> and &#60;ins> elements, as appropriate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;samp></strong> -element is used to enclose inline text
            which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program.
            Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default
            monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;script></strong> -element is used to embed executable
            code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript
            code. The &#60;script> element can also be used with other
            languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and
            JSON.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;section></strong> -element represents a generic
            standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific
            semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a
            heading, with very few exceptions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;select></strong> -element represents a control that
            provides a menu of options.

        <li class="dep"><del>&#60;shadow></del> Deprocated</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;slot></strong> -element—part of the Web Components
            technology suite—is a placeholder inside a web component that you
            can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM
            trees and present them together.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;small></strong> -element represents side-comments and
            small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its
            styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one
            font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;source></strong> element specifies multiple media
            resources for the &#60;picture>, the &#60;audio> element, or the
            &#60;video> element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no
            content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to
            offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to
            provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their
            differing support for image file formats and media file formats.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;span></strong> -element is a generic inline container
            for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything.
            It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the
            class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values,
            such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element
            is appropriate. &#60;span> is very much like a &#60;div> element,
            but &#60;div> is a block-level element whereas a &#60;span> is an
            inline element.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;strong></strong> -element indicates that its contents
            have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically
            render the contents in bold type.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;style></strong> -element contains style information for
            a document, or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied
            to the contents of the document containing the &#60;style> element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;sub></strong> -element specifies inline text which
            should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons.
            Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using
            smaller text.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;summary></strong> -element specifies a summary,
            caption, or legend for a &#60;details> element's disclosure box.
            Clicking the &#60;summary> element toggles the state of the parent
            &#60;details> element open and closed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;sup></strong> -element specifies inline text which is
            to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons.
            Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using
            smaller text.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;table></strong> -element represents tabular data — that
            is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of
            rows and columns of cells containing data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;tbody></strong> -element encapsulates a set of table
            rows (&#60;tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of
            the table (&#60;table>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;td></strong> -element defines a cell of a table that
            contains data. It participates in the table model.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;template></strong> -element is a mechanism for holding
            HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded
            but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using
            JavaScript.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;textarea></strong> -element represents a multi-line
            plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to
            enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on
            a review or feedback form.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;tfoot></strong> -element defines a set of rows
            summarizing the columns of the table.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;th></strong> -element defines a cell as the header of a
            group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is defined by
            the scope and headers attributes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;thead></strong> -element defines a set of rows defining

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;time></strong> -element represents a specific period in
            time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into
            machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results
            or custom features such as reminders.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;title></strong> -element defines the document's title
            that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only
            contains text; tags within the element are ignored.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;tr></strong> -element defines a row of cells in a
            table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of
            &#60;td> (data cell) and &#60;th> (header cell) elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;track></strong> -element is used as a child of the
            media elements, &#60;audio> and &#60;video>. It lets you specify
            timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically
            handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt
            files) — Web Video Text Tracks.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;u></strong> -element represents a span of inline text
            which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a
            non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple
            solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;ul></strong> -element represents an unordered list of
            items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;var></strong> -element represents the name of a
            variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's
            typically presented using an italicized version of the current
            typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;video></strong> -element embeds a media player which
            supports video playback into the document. You can use &#60;video>
            for audio content as well, but the &#60;audio> element may provide a
            more appropriate user experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>&#60;wbr></strong> -element represents a word break
            opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally
            break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise
            create a break at that location.
          </p>
